## Build an extended version of docker-node4dev
You'll probably start from work done in a container.

You can build your own image starting with

    FROM rockyroad/-node4dev`

or, to synergize our efforts, work on a fork of this initial repo,
and then submit your [pull request]().

Given the layered architecture of docker images, this should
not increase your build time.
